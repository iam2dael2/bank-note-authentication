# Bank Note Authentication
## Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify and authenticate banknotes. The project will utilize the Banknote Authentication dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which consists of various features extracted from images of genuine and forged banknotes.

## Dataset Description
The Banknote Authentication dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is a widely used dataset for binary classification tasks related to banknote authenticity. It consists of a collection of features extracted from images of genuine and forged banknotes.

### Dataset Details
Number of Instances: 1,372
Number of Attributes: 5 (including the target variable)
Attribute Information:
Variance of Wavelet Transformed Image: Represents the variance of the wavelet transformed image's pixel values.
Skewness of Wavelet Transformed Image: Measures the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the wavelet transformed image.
Kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed Image: Reflects the peakedness or flatness of the wavelet transformed image's pixel values distribution.
Entropy of Image: Represents the amount of randomness or unpredictability in the image's pixel values.
Class: The target variable indicating the authenticity of the banknote. It takes two values: 0 (denoting a genuine banknote) and 1 (denoting a forged banknote).

### Dataset Source
The Banknote Authentication dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was created by extracting numerical features from a set of 400 x 400 grayscale images of banknotes obtained from a bank in Poland. The images were transformed using a wavelet transform, resulting in the features provided in the dataset.
